# simple-tic-tac-toe
for My friend HJ who struggled with make tic-tac-toe algorithm. (I wish this would be helpful.)

1. you can draw 'O' or 'X' on board using number(human-friendly).
2. if you input worng number you have to re-input to board.
3. who is winner? -> someone who makes 3 straight line(vertical, horizontal, diagonal) game over.
4. when is draw? -> nobody makes 3 straight line and all the space on the board is full.
